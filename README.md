# Company Sales Analysis

### Project Overview
In the course of this project, I leveraged Microsoft Excel to craft insightful charts and dashboards using sales data from a company. Employing PivotTables, I meticulously examined discrete trends within the data, translating key insights into visually compelling line, bar, and pie charts. As the project reached its conclusion, I distilled the comprehensive sales data into a cohesive dashboard, integrating a harmonious blend of charts and tables. This amalgamation serves to offer a holistic and succinct overview of the company's sales performance.

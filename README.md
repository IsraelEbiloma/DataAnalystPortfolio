PROJECTS
Project Overview
In the course of this project, I leveraged Microsoft Excel to craft insightful charts and dashboards using sales data from a fictitious company. Employing PivotTables, I meticulously examined discrete trends within the data, translating key insights into visually compelling line, bar, and pie charts.

This amalgamation serves to offer a holistic and succinct overview of the company's sales performance
